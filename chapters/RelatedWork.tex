\section{Real-Time Stereo Vision}
The area of Stereo Vision is well researched, however the real-time application of it is less so.  Sutton et al \cite{Sutton} explored Real-Time Stereo Vision on a modern pc using lower resolution images and achieved a processing speed of around 8 frames per second (fps).  Their solution utilized only the CPU to perform the calculations and was therefore quite slow.  Another possible solution involves the use of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).  Wang et al\cite{Wang:2} implemented a Stereo Vision system on an Altera Stratix-IV FPGA board capable of processing 1024x768 images at around 30 fps.
