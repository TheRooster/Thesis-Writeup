\subsection{Hardware}
The hardware involved in this research was one Raspberry pi 2.  The Raspberry pi 2 consists of a quad core ARM Cortex A7 processor clocked at 900mhz coupled to a Broadcom VideoCore IV 3D graphics processor.
\subsection{Data}
Several Stereo vision datasets were used in the process of this research.  In addition to datasets generated specifically for this research, the XXX and XXX datasets were also used for sanity checking.
\subsection{Process}
The first step in this research was to compile the OpenCV library on the Raspberry Pi 2.  Once this was complete the camera calibration described earlier was performed using the StereoCalibrate() function built into OpenCV.  The results of this function is a camera matrix describing the fundamental parameters of each camera along with a set of distortion coefficients for each of the cameras.  Additionally, this function outputs a rotation matrix from camera1 to camera2, and a translation vector between the same.  All of these parameters were then passed to the stereoRectify() function which was also built into OpenCV.  The stereoRectify() function returns a rotation and projection matrix for each of the camera that reprojects both images onto a shared plane.  This is important because it allows us to turn a 2-Dimensional search for correspondence into a 1-Dimensional search along the scanline of an image.  It is at this point that the processes diverge.  For the baseline measurement, these matrices were passed into
